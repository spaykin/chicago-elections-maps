# Chicago Election Maps

This repository contains data used for creating maps for elections canvassing and organizing in Chicago city, state, and federal legislative and administrative districts. These maps were created for [United Working Families](https://www.unitedworkingfamilies.org/), an independent political organization for the many, not the few. UWF recruits, trains, runs, and wins with Black and Latinx candidates who come from the rank and file of movements for racial, social, and economic justice. 

For the upcoming 2022 Elections, I created a map of the (new; approved 2021) **IL 4th State House District** with overlays:
* Chicago Wards
* Chicago Election Precincts 
* IL-3 Congressional District

For the 2019 Elections, I created maps of the (old; approved 2013) **IL 4th State House District** and **9th State House District** with overlays: 
* Chicago Wards
* Chicago Election Precincts
* Cook County Election Precincts (bordering)
